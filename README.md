# python_war_or_peace
This is my first project from school where we were building War the card game

The goal of this project is to learn basics of Python (School was taught in Ruby)

So to teach myself python I wanted to work on a simple project that i was familiar with so that i could make direct comparisons to my Ruby  version.
